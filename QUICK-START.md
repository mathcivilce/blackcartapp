## üêõ Common Issues

### "Protection toggle doesn't appear"
**Solution**: Settings API needs protection product ID. For testing, it's auto-set to `99999999`.

### "Toggle doesn't add/remove"
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Make sure test page mock fetch is working.

### "Settings don't save"
**Solution**: Dev server must be running (`npm run dev`) for settings API to work.

### "Changes don't appear in cart"
**Solution**: Close and reopen test page after changing settings.
