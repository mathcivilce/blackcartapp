# Dashboard Updates - Sales Stats and Revenue Chart

## Overview
Updated the dashboard page with real sales data, removed installation sections, and added a sales revenue chart with date range filtering.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sidebar Icon Update
**File:** `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`

**Changed:**
- Sales icon from `💰` (colorful) to `▤` (monochrome)

**Why:** Consistent monochrome design across the sidebar menu

**File:** `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`

#### **Removed Sections:**
- ❌ Installation section with script code
- ❌ Next Steps section with configuration list

#### **Added Features:**

##### **Real Sales Statistics**
Replaced static placeholder cards with live data from `/api/user/sales`:
- **Total Sales** - Count of all protection sales
- **Total Revenue** - Sum of all protection prices
- **Your Commission (75%)** - User's share of revenue
- **Platform Fee (25%)** - Platform's commission

A visual line chart showing revenue over time with:

**Features:**
- ✅ Line graph with data points
- ✅ Y-axis showing revenue amounts

- ✅ Date range selector dropdown

**Date Range Options:**
- Last 7 Days

- All Time

**Chart Behavior:**
- Groups sales by day
- Scales Y-axis based on max revenue
- Shows smooth line connecting data points
- White line with circular markers
- Dark theme with grid lines

**States:**
- Loading state with spinner
- Empty state when no data

**Added:**

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Component loads and fetches sales from `/api/user/sales`
2. Calculates totals (revenue, commission, sales count)
3. Filters sales based on selected date range
4. Groups sales by day for chart rendering
5. Scales chart based on max revenue value

### Chart Implementation
- Uses SVG for smooth, scalable rendering
- Polyline for connecting data points
- Circle elements for markers
- Dynamic viewBox based on data points
- Preserves aspect ratio: false for proper stretching

### Performance
- Fetches data once on mount
- Client-side filtering (no API calls on range change)
- Efficient data grouping using object map
- Minimal re-renders
